https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v44/n13/katrina-forrester/on-the-disassembly-line,https://archive.ph/8AeY7,On the Disassembly Line,"""Microwork is hidden and fragmented in a way that makes collective action particularly difficult. Like other employers in the gig economy, those who employ microworkers have gone to great lengths to avoid classifying their workers as employees and to prevent them acting in concert. Jones describes the result as a new form of ‘economic blindness’. The lack of a workplace or colleagues, and the absence of laws and protocols governing terms of employment, leave workers vulnerable. The purpose of the individual tasks they perform is often unclear (‘why am I labelling an apple?’), let alone any sense of their amounting to a meaningful whole.""",Katrina Forrester,2022-07-09,LRB,

Insta­gram is presently: extremely slip­pery — squirming its way out of all its old contracts and expectations, strug­gling to become some­thing basi­cally unrecog­niz­able to its long­time users. Bummer. (And, I’m sure I’m not the only user whose ad load has increased 5X or more. It reeks of desperation.)""",Robin Sloane,2022-07-25,Robin Sloane,

Proper binmen “didn’t care about Health & Safety Shite”, writes another. The plastic wheelie bins we have today – with their emasculating pastels, often colour-coded for recycling, and their humiliating, labour-saving wheels – are just further markers of our moral, social and spiritual decline.""",Dan Hancox,2022-11-18,The Guardian,
