https://archive.ph/8AeY7,On the Disassembly Line,"""Microwork is hidden and fragmented in a way that makes collective action particularly difficult. Like other employers in the gig economy, those who employ microworkers have gone to great lengths to avoid classifying their workers as employees and to prevent them acting in concert. Jones describes the result as a new form of ‘economic blindness’. The lack of a workplace or colleagues, and the absence of laws and protocols governing terms of employment, leave workers vulnerable. The purpose of the individual tasks they perform is often unclear (‘why am I labelling an apple?’), let alone any sense of their amounting to a meaningful whole.""",Katrina Forrester,2022-07-09,LRB,https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v44/n13/katrina-forrester/on-the-disassembly-line,

https://archive.ph/CUKDN,Visions,"""I’ve come to believe the fun­da­men­tal prop­erty of dig­i­tal media is slipperiness. Dif­fer­ent plat­forms are different kinds of slippery at dif­fer­ent times. Insta­gram is presently: extremely slip­pery — squirming its way out of all its old contracts and expectations, strug­gling to become some­thing basi­cally unrecog­niz­able to its long­time users. Bummer. (And, I’m sure I’m not the only user whose ad load has increased 5X or more.
